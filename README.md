# the-breakout-game

The breakout game programmed using python language begins with eight rows of bricks, with every two rows different kinds of color. The color order from the bottom up is yellow, blue, green, and red. Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, they will lose a turn. The player has three turns to try to clear the screen of bricks. if the player hits 10 bricks it will change into tringles, if he hits 20 of them it will change the shape into turtles. if he hits 20 of them we will increase the speed of the ball. the player will win after he clears the screen of bricks.
